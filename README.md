# RESTPopocatepetl

This is an API that manually scrapes information from CENAPRED regarding the daily status of Popocatepetl.

However, it's unfinished at the moment. I need to find a cost-effective way to translate some of it and I need to do more information. Currently the phase endpoint works as expected, the direction of plume works in Spanish.
